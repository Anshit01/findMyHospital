### What is FindMyHospital?
FindMyHospital is a website where people can **search** for the **nearest the hospital** and can **find their blood groups**. This website also provides other major information about the Hospitals like *number of beds, Operation Theatre, hosiptal's contact details, working hours and doctor's specialisation*.

### Why FindMyHospital?
Whenever someone gets **injured** accidently in any place and he **needs blood** immediately. But in some cases what happens we don't whether the exact **blood group of person is available in hosiptal's** blood bank or not and it cost person's life due to lack of time. Here **FindMyHospital comes in place**. ***It tells the person about the nearest hospital where the injured person can find the matching blood group.***
People can also look for the specialisation of the doctor and the timings of nursing home or hosiptal.
So, this website has a special focus over the accessability of Blood within time.
